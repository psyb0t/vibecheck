# go.mod / go.sum are intentionally NOT copied by rsync (see do_update.sh):
# a wholesale replace drops every `require` for the downstream's own deps, and the
# following `go mod tidy` would re-resolve them DOWN to the lowest version MVS
# allows -- a silent, dangerous downgrade (go mod tidy only grabs *latest* for a
# dep referenced NOWHERE in the graph; a dep that survives only as a transitive
# requirement resolves to that low floor instead).
#
# Instead, merge the freshly-downloaded framework's direct requires + tool
# directives into the downstream's existing go.mod UPGRADE-ONLY: add what's
# missing, bump what the framework raised, and NEVER touch a dep the downstream
# already pins at an equal-or-higher version. `go mod tidy` then computes the MVS
# max over the union, so the framework's bumps land while the downstream's own
# (possibly-newer) deps stay intact.
