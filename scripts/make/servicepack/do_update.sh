# Servicepack update — apply phase.
#
# This script carries ALL the update POLICY (rsync exclude list, dependency
# merge, branch/commit dance) and is ALWAYS executed from the freshly
# downloaded framework copy, handed off to by the thin bootstrap
# servicepack_update.sh. A running updater cannot swap its own logic mid-run,
# so the policy lives here and runs from the download — the newest policy
# always drives the sync, on the very first update that ships it. Never move
# policy back into the bootstrap.
#
# Args (all passed by servicepack_update.sh):
#   $1 REPO_ROOT        - the downstream project's checkout (the repo to update)
#   $2 TEMP_DIR         - the freshly cloned latest framework
#   $3 CURRENT_VERSION  - the downstream's servicepack.version before this update
#   $4 LATEST_VERSION   - the framework version being installed

section "Updating Framework Files"

# Build exclude args - default excludes (protect user content).
#
# CHANGELOG.md is per-project (documents the DOWNSTREAM app's releases, not
# servicepack's) so the framework never owns it.
#
# go.mod / go.sum are NOT copied by rsync because rsync has no merge semantics:
# a wholesale replace would drop every `require` line for the downstream's own
# deps, and the following `go mod tidy` would then re-resolve them DOWN to the
# lowest version MVS allows (a silent, dangerous downgrade). Instead the
# framework's dependency bumps are merged into the downstream's existing go.mod
# UPGRADE-ONLY in _post_update.sh (see merge_framework_deps). This keeps the
# downstream's own, possibly-newer deps intact while still pulling servicepack's
# framework-dep floors forward so the freshly-synced framework code compiles.
#
# Everything else the framework owns and overwrites (incl. .golangci.yml). A
# downstream that has genuinely customized a framework-owned file lists it in
# ITS OWN .servicepackupdateignore -- that is the intended opt-out, not a
# blanket exclude baked into the framework.
#
# The list above is the mechanical floor (git internals, the dependency merge,
# per-project prose, and the downstream-owned docs/ and tests/ trees). The
# opt-outs that nearly every project wants ship
# in the .servicepackupdateignore this repo hands you -- the framework's own
# publication workflows, agent skill, funding links, secret-scanning allowlist
# and docker context. Those are the framework's furniture rather than a
# baseline you customize, so they start ignored instead of leaving each project
# to find out the hard way. Read that file, not this list, when you want to
# know what your project is keeping for itself.
#
# Note that file is excluded from the sync (above), so it is yours from the
# moment you scaffold: a framework update can never rewrite your opt-outs, and
# equally never adds new default ones to an existing project. When a release
# adds an entry, existing downstreams have to copy it over by hand.
# An ARRAY, not a string, and passed to rsync without `eval`.
#
# This used to be one space-joined string expanded through `eval`, with the
# downstream's own .servicepackupdateignore lines concatenated onto it below.
# eval re-parses that whole command line, so any shell metacharacter in that
# file — a backtick, a $(...), a ; — executed during `make servicepack-update`.
# An array member is passed to rsync as a single literal argument, so the
# contents of that file can no longer be anything but a pattern.
#
# The `*` in the first entry is deliberate and must stay unexpanded: rsync does
# its own pattern matching, and quoting is what guarantees the shell keeps its
# hands off it.
