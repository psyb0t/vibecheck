//go:build integration

// Package integration holds servicepack's integration tests. The baseline is the
// very bottom of the pyramid: build the servicepack image and run it, confirming
// the application boots with whatever services are registered. It asserts nothing
// about any specific service, so a downstream keeps this test verbatim and it
// keeps passing as it swaps in its own services and Dockerfile.
